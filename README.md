# *Final Project for Research Computing in Earth Science*
## *Investigating Ocean Acidification in the Arctic* 
**CANNOT overlap with another class- does that mean I can't use SOCAT data? Maybe look at one of the predictor variable driver data or Climate Bench so can still familiarize
*Look at this concept (https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00419-4) but using following datasets

use data from here:
https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/files/


url = 'https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/files/nsidcCDRiceSQsh1day/2017/seaice_conc_daily_sh_f17_20170807_v03r01.nc'


Sea ice conc: Sea Ice Concentration, NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record V3, Arctic, 25km, Science Quality, 1978-2019, Monthly DEPRECATED
https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/files/nsidcCDRiceSQnhmday/
**use open_mfdataset


or 
https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/files/nsidcCDRice_nh_grid/

SST monthly means: https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/files/afsc_sst/sst.csv

and then how get pCO2? SOCAT data may be very limited up there, maybe use a climate model instead?
OR, CESM hindcast

Create a new public github repo for your project
Add a README.md file which contains the scientific question / hypothesis you plan to investigate, links to the relevant datasets, and a three sentence summary of the analysis you plan to do.
Submit a link to your project repo using the method indicated by the instructor.
